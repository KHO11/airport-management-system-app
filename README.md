# airport-management-system-app

A web application from a project during an apprenticeship where the user choose a take off and landing countdown timers chosen for specific aircrafts. The application features 4 different aircrafts as options to choose from and 4 runways that will hold the times. Eveytime a take off or landing time is picked and is allocated to a chosen runway, after the time reaches zero there is a 7 minute to make sure there are no problems with runway and is can be used next.  

# Lessons learned

My first big project in html, css and JavaScript. I had to learn how to use the functions to hold different times for specific aircrafts, and try to make the code as clean as possible and easier to read. 

# Potential future Features

I realised a way to shorten the code and make it more efficient is to use classes to hold the times and other information. The functions that handle the times and the allocations to other runways, can call times from the classes instead of repeatedly calling them every time in a longer way.
